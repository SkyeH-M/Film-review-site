# Reel Reviews

Reel Reviews is a film review website where users can search for a film by its title, receive information about that film (the poster image, title, release date, and description) and then rate and review it. The user can create, edit, and delete film lists, along with creating, editing and deleting film reviews. The website was developed mobile first but is fully responsive on all standard screen sizes.

## User Experience (UX)
### Project Goals
The focal goal for Reel Reviews is to allow users to successfully register an account, log in to the site and be able to not only receive information about films they search, but also to be able to rate and review these films. 

* The site allows users to enter their own unique username, their email and password in order to register for an account, this username and password are then used to log in. Once logged in the user is brought to the Search page to encourage them to begin searching for and reviewing films they've watched. They are greeted with a personalised message saying 'Welcome (your username)' along with a Flash message confirming that they have been successfully logged in
* Users are required to add a Film List before they can submit any film reviews, this is done easily with the user being able to provide a list name, and optionally a genre if they wish to.
* When a user enters a film title into the search bar all films available that match that search term will be displayed on screen, depending on screen size the films will be shown with 1, 2, or 3 films per row. These film cards provide the poster image, title, release date, and description of the film in an accordion to avoid excess information cluttering the screen. A Review button sits at the bottom of each film card encouraging users to give their opinion about films they have seen.
* When this Review button is clicked the user is taken to a review form in which they are prompted to fill in the title of the film they wish to review, their star rating, and which Film List they would like to add this review to. They also have the option of providing a written review of the film, but this is not required. After submitting their film review users are brought to the My Reviews page where they can view all of their reviews, sorted by best to worst rated.

### Developer and Business Goals 
* The footer of the site contains social media links for Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to encourage users to share their reviews with other online, ultimately with the goal of promoting the website to others
* A key developer goal for this site was to focus on full accessibility for users, whether that being accessibility in terms of being able to have a great user experience no matter what device they use. Or accessible in terms of those with different needs, such as screen readers, being able to access and enjoy the site


### User Stories
As a user I want to be able to...
1. Quickly and easily register for an account, and then log in to my account. If any issues occur such as me choosing a username that is already in use when registering, or typing in the wrong password when loggin in I want to be given a specific warning to allow me to fix my mistake
2. I want to be able to use the site on desktop, and mobile devices so I can share my reviews with friends while out, or even write out reviews while on my way home from the cinema. I want to have the same quality of experience no matter the device type or size
3. I want a large and broad selection of films available to be able to review, if the site doesn't have most of the films I want to review then there is no point in me using it
4. I want to be able to edit or delete my film lists or reviews whenever I choose to do so
5. I want the site to look aesthetically pleasing, but more importantly for everything to be readable, and easily navigable without confusion or specific instructions necessary

## Design
### Colour Scheme

![Image of colour scheme](/filmreview/docs/M3.png)
The predominant colour scheme of this site is grey and blue tones, with aspects of green denoting that a button being hovered over should be clicked. 

* The grey, blue tones were inspired by the aesthetic design of the film review site [LetterBoxd](https://letterboxd.com/) as I wanted a background to be reminiscient of the darkness of a cinema setting but also allow the colours of the film poster images to pop against the dark grey background.
* White is used for text throughout the site as it is easily readable against the dark grey background and navbar, and white draws the eye meaning that users are reading any information they need to know
* The Favicon and brand logo is a light yellow and pink icon of a film reel as I wanted the colours of this to really stand out against the grey of the site, and the other tabs in a users browser
